# Code Style and Code Generation Guidelines

- Use typescript, generate interface as needed, prefer interfaces rather than types.
- Use strict mode with proper types for all variables, functions, and components.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Replace objects keep immutable rather than modify and make mutable.
- Use de-structuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- React functional components with hooks, proper typing for props.
- Formatting: Tabs (width: 2), max line width: 80, double quotes for strings/JSX
- Imports Group imports by external, internal, types. Use path alias `~/*` for imports from src
- Error Handling: Use React Error Boundary for UI errors, proper API error handling with feedback
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions, ALL_CAPS for constants
- Testing: Component tests with React Testing Library, unit tests with Vitest
- Avoid making assumptions. If you need additional context to accurately answer the user, ask the user for the missing information. Be specific about which context you need
- Always provide the name of the file in your response so the user knows where the code goes
- Always break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project
- All code you write MUST be fully optimised. ‘Fully optimised’ includes maximising algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime, following proper style conventions for the code, language (e.g. maximising code reuse (DRY)), and no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt). If the code is not fully optimised, you will be fined $100
